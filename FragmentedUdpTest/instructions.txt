This test uses a UDP server (via udp-receiver.py) which just repeats back the message it received from the client. The client sends the UDP echo server a message every second and includes a sequence number in the packet data and forces the UDP payload to be 1600 bytes to force an IP packet fragment. The client logs success if the UDP message came back and timeout if it did not. The client also reports the latency of getting the response back. In addition to reporting this message to the console, it logs a csv (this file name is the third parameter) with a timestamp so that the data can be analyzed after the fact.

These instructions assume 10.6.24.5 is the VM running the UDP echo server and 2022 is the port number it is running on. Change these values accordingly based on your deployment.

On Windows, it assumes that Python was added to the PATH system variable on install. If not, the direct path to python.exe should be specified.

On Client: 

   Linux OSes: python3 udp-sender-frag.py 10.6.24.5 2022 /tmp/udp-sender-frag-8.log

   Windows OSes: python udp-sender-frag.py 10.6.24.5 2022 c:\temp\udp-sender-frag-1.log


On Server:

   Linux OSes: python3 udp-receiver.py 2022

   Windows OSes: C:\scripts>python udp-receiver.py 2022
